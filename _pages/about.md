Hi, this is Zihao Zhu (朱梓豪). I am currently a Ph.D. student in Data Science at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn), under the supervision of Prof. [Baoyuan Wu](https://sites.google.com/site/baoyuanwu2015). Previously, I received my Master's degree from the Institute of Information Engineering at the [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://www.ucas.edu.cn) in 2021.

<!-- My research interests lie in the broad area of AI security, spanning three main directions: security of large language models (e.g. jailbreak attacks and alignment), data security in data-centric AI (DCAI) systems (e.g. backdoor attacks and data quality assessment), and security concerns in embodied AI (e.g. risk assessment for AI agents). Through my work published in top-tier venues like ICLR, NeurIPS. I strive to develop more robust and reliable AI systems while identifying and addressing potential security vulnerabilities.   -->

My research interests lie in the broad area of AI security, with focuses on three main directions:

- **Security of Large Language Models**: I work on understanding and addressing security challenges in LLMs, including jailbreak attacks and AI alignment. This research aims to make language models more robust while maintaining their utility.
- **Data Security in AI Systems**: Data is the fuel of AI.  I investigate various aspects of data security in Data-centric AI (DCAI), with particular emphasis on backdoor attacks and  data quality assessment. 
- **Security in Embodied AI**: I explore security concerns in embodied AI systems, focusing on risk assessment for AI agents. This emerging area is crucial as AI systems become more integrated into physical environments.
